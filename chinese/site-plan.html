        Is Chinese Difficult or Not?<br>There are many reasons why native English speakers find it difficult to learn Chinese. 
        Many people find the characters it uses hard to learn. It is not a phonetic language like English so you cannot read something if you 
        don't know that character. Another reason that it is so difficult is that it is a tonal language. It has 4 tones and a neutral tone. There 
        are many more reasons why this language is hard to learn but this website will only go into depth about the ones previously mentioned.

      </ul>
      <h3>Writing System page</h3>
      <p>
        Writing System<br>The writing system that is used in chinese are characters. There are two sets of characters that you can use. There are traditional
        or simplified characters. Traditional characters have more strokes or lines to write the character. The look more similar to the characters used anciently. 
        The simplified version of the characters was put into practice to make learning to read and write easier which would also increase literacy. In the 1950s, a 
        phonetic system using the latic alphabet was invented to improve literacy as well and help the language become more accessible. It made it easier for foreigners
        to learn the language and connect them with the rest of the world. Pinyin is now widely used to learn chinese and makes learning how to read a character much easier.
        The stroke order of each character is important when you are writing them. If you do the wrong stroke order it can make the character look weird or even unrecognizable.
        Especially in calligraphy, you need to be careful to do the right strokes from the right angles to make the character look beautiful while still being recognizable. It is
        also very important to know the correct stroke order for when you need to look up a character in chinese. If you are putting in the wrong stroke or in a phone or looking it 
        up in a book then you might not be able to find what you need. Another way the writing system is different is that the word order is not the same. There are some 
        parts that are similar like how we put the subject, verb, and then object in a sentence. There are rules for where to put certain words like time and place that are different 
        than English. In Chinese, you would structure the sentence with the subject, time, place, verb, and then object which might feel unnatural to native English speakers at first. 
        There are many other rules that will force you to think differently. For example, instead of saying Monday, February 2, 2023 you would say 2023 February 2, Monday. This is hard to 
        get used to as a native English speaker. There are many things that many things that you will have to practice a lot if you want to master this language.

      </ul>
      <h3>Tones Page</h3>
      <p>
        Tones<br>There are 4 tones in Mandarin Chinese. The first tone is a high pitch. The second tone is a rising tone going from low to high. The 
        third tone starts at a neutral pitch, dips lower, and then rises to a little below the first tone. The forth tone goes from high to low. The neutral tone
        is just your natural speaking pitch and so it is not labelled as a specific tone. The neutral tone is used when there is no tone mark for the character.
        The tones of this language can be difficult to master. Spending time practicing them will help them become much easier and natural to you the more you practice.
        The tones are also very important to get right or you can say things that you don't mean. It can also put you in some embarrassing situations. For example, if you 
        are talking about your mom but you on accident call her a horse. This is one of many ways that misunderstandings can happen.
