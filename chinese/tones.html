            <h3>What Makes Them So Difficult?</h3>
            <p>There are 4 tones in Mandarin Chinese. The first tone is a high pitch. The second tone is a rising tone going from low to high. The third tone starts at a neutral pitch, dips lower, and then rises to a little below the first tone. The forth tone goes from high to low. The neutral tone is just your natural speaking pitch and so it is not labelled as a specific tone. The neutral tone is used when there is no tone mark for the character. The tones of this language can be difficult to master. Spending time practicing them will help them become much easier and natural to you the more you practice. The tones are also very important to get right or you can say things that you don't mean. It can also put you in some embarrassing situations. For example, if you are talking about your mom but you on accident call her a horse. This is one of many ways that misunderstandings can happen.</p>

            <h3>Examples of Tones in English</h3>
            <p>In English we uses intonation to indicate attitude. It is similar to tones in Chinese but they aren't used to change the meaning of the word. If someone says "I really like this" excitedly then you would assume that they really like whatever that is. However, if they said, "I really like this" with a sarcastic tone then you would think that they don't like it. We use intonation to change how a message is recieved but the words stay the same. In Chinese, they use tones to say different words. They do not have the liberty to use intonation to imply meaning so they have to use extra "feeling" words to express how the feel about what they are saying. You can learn the tones of Chinese by finding different instances of intonation in English and transfer the sounds over to Chinese.</p>
