            <h3>Characters:<br>Traditional vs Simplified</h3>
            <p>There are two sets of characters that you can use. There are traditional or simplified characters. Traditional characters have more strokes or lines to write the character. The look more similar to the characters used anciently. The simplified version of the characters was put into practice to make learning to read and write easier which would also increase literacy.</p>

            <h3>Pinyin</h3>
            <p>In the 1950s, a phonetic system using the latic alphabet was invented to improve literacy as well and help the language become more accessible. It made it easier for foreigners to learn the language and connect them with the rest of the world. Pinyin is now widely used to learn chinese and makes learning how to read a character much easier.</p>

            <h3>Word Order</h3>
            <p>Another way the writing system is different is that the word order is not the same. There are some parts that are similar like how we put the subject, verb, and then object in a sentence. There are rules for where to put certain words like time and place that are different than English. In Chinese, you would structure the sentence with the subject, time, place, verb, and then object which might feel unnatural to native English speakers at first. There are many other rules that will force you to think differently. For example, instead of saying Monday, February 2, 2023 you would say 2023 February 2, Monday.</p>

            <h3>Stroke Order</h3>
            <p>The stroke order of each character is important when you are writing them. If you do the wrong stroke order it can make the character look weird or even unrecognizable. Especially in calligraphy, you need to be careful to do the right strokes from the right angles to make the character look beautiful while still being recognizable. It is also very important to know the correct stroke order for when you need to look up a character in chinese. If you are putting in the wrong stroke or in a phone or looking it up in a book then you might not be able to find what you need.</p>
